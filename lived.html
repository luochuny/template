		<h1>lived experiences project title</h1>
		<p>The purpose of the article is to show one of the technologies that had impact me to choose the academic major. The thing I am going to argue is that the relationship between mathematical model and my major mathematics. Why does the mathematical model push me to choose math major also will be showed. Mine experiences with mathematical model. How does the experience linked to my choice, and then I will have a conclusion at the end of article. 
Math was used thousands of years ago. In all ages, mathematics is important for the whole world. Mathematics is related to trivia in normal life. For instance, when the persons go to buy something they need to calculate in math. Otherwise, the content of the economic in class is also connected to the mathematics. Everywhere that has number will relate to the math. On the other hand, mathematic has important status in science field. Mathematics is one of the main majors that every student has to study in natural science. Mathematics is the basement of the majors in natural science. Such like physics, astronomy and chemistry. Mathematics has big contribution on human development. All the things that had been invented in this world may relate to math. For example, computer was invented by using a lot of data. Mathematical model which is one of the significant inventions is all about the math. It is a system made by math concepts and language something like equation or formula. The math is full of your life, full of each corner in this world.
Mathematical model is a kind of abstract thing. Mathematical model is used to establish the relationship between different by using model. It may constitute by images, mathematics symbol and the equations etc. Mathematical model is used very wide range. Mathematical model is used in natural science, social science, economic and others. It is best to make a model when you are trying to do something. It can help you to find the problems while you are in trouble. Even it can predict the change of the event. For example, weather forecast is base on kind of mathematical model. According to the change of the data in model, scientist can have distinguished of the weather. Set up a mathematical model for a company is very helpful. The model shows the causal relationship between order, manufacture and selling. There was a very successful example that I knew in China. Crocs which is a kind of shoes brand. It had very successful selling in China from 2011 to 2013. Mainly every Chinese has one pair of Crocs or more than one. It was very popular in that time. Not only the Crocs has beautiful design or it is cute, but also it has a wonderful mathematical model for ordering, manufacturing and selling. Everybody in this company follow their things in highly effective. They had the same target which is having good design, good quality and good serving. It caught the every possible customer.
The thing that had affected me to choose the major happened in senior high school. In these three years, I have read a lot of Chinese novels. The reason is from the one of these novels that I had read. The protagonist is a man who is really good at science, such as math, physics and chemistry. Math is his best. There is a college entrance examination in China something like SAT. He got the greatest score in his province in that exam. Finally, he chooses the mathematic while he goes to the university. In his second year in university, he did something is craze. The protagonist stays at a room for a month because of a promising that he gave to his friend. He was making an economic mathematical model in this month. He sleeps for only 4 hours a day. And the other 20 hours is for searching the source and make the model. In a month later, while he was sleeping, the model had sharked everybody in business field. Although it is very complete that lots of people cannot understand, it is a wonderful system that may huge business profit. At that time, I did not know what the mathematical model is. I did a lot of research when I went back home. Finally, I knew what is it working for and why is it need long time to make one. Mathematical model is also the reason that crocs become popular at that time. 
After read this novel, I had decided what I am going to study in university. I want to be a man like protagonist. Be like protagonist, I am also good at science rather than liberal arts. But as a senior high school student, the mathematical model was so abstruse for us. We have no chance to touch that kind of thing in high school. But as a high school student who is going to the university, I knew that mathematics is a basement subject in university, and also a main major. Be an actuary is my target when I graduate from university. Actuary is very popular for the whole social. Actuary need to analyze causal relationship between different things. And then they need to give out several schemes by making mathematical models. I decided to study mathematics in university in senior high school, because I knew I am sensitive in numbers. Be an actuary is the best choice for me. All the courses that are required by math are also required by actuary. 
In conclusion, the things are changing at any time, may be it will get better, may be it will be bad. The track for me is affected by reading a novel. I cannot predict what will happen in future, but I will keep going in this track. Mathematical model have a big contribution in human development. It helps people to analyze the things in logic. It is very important for human, although it is very difficult to learn. It is the necessities in human developing. Especially in economy field, making a mathematical model is the premise for you to do investment. A wonderful mathematical model may bring huge benefit for the company. And it also can help you to avoid unnecessary step in your investment. My major is mathematics that all the courses are also required in Actuary. Both of these two majors are related to mathematical models.
