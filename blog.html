			<p>I thought the purpose of the vedio is to tell andbody should keep smiling at anytime and the things will get better. 
                        The Man in the video as a guy,he was painful and lose cause his family does not like guy man. He need his uncle to raise him and a shoulder to cry.
                        finally, he gets better.
                        This vedio let me know that writing a project should have a summarize at first. Leading the audioence to know what are you writing 
                        about. And then, describe the specific things in the others paragraphs.</p>
                        <h1>make love, not warcraft</h1>
                        After reading this video,i thought the world should be a big warm family. From the game, we can see that the students are engrossed in game. They were kiiled
                        by a powerful player, but they do not concede. They spent a lots of time in game. When they thought they can beat him, but they failed. Finnaly, one of the student's
                        father gave them a ultimate weapon from the company. Finally, the man who craft the world dead.
                        Everyone in this world should protect the it, but not destroy it.
